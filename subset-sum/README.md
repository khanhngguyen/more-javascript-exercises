Write a function that, given a array of non-negative integers and a value of sum, return subsets from array whose sum of all elements equals to the given sum

For example:
- [ 1, 2, 3 ], sum = 5 => [ 2, 3 ]
- [ 3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2 ], sum = 30 => no subset available
- [ 3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2 ], sum = 9 => [4, 5]
